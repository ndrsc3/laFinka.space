## Our Values
- Community
- Artistic Expression
- Freedom

## The Past 
The house was originally constructed in 1962 on 1.8 Acres in Reno's Old Southwest Neighborhood by the Edmiston Estate. As the neighborhood was granted with surface water rights and access to Lake Ditch's water distribution for irrigation. In the 1980s a 400ft well was drilled enabling access to 160Â° F ground water and the house was converted to run off geothermal energy to heat the house (hot water / furnace), as well as the hot tub & pool.   

## The Present
The property was purchased amidst the Covid Shutdown in April of 2020 by The SNM Brothers ( Stephanos & Niko ). During the pandemic it offered recluse and the comfort of a home as well as many projects to occupy the mind. It became a gathering place for friends and family from all over.

## The Future
La Finka is now curating a community within the larger Reno & Tahoe area focused on exploring the possible futures that lay ahead.
