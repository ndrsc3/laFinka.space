{% comment %} 
La Finka was originally constructed in 1962 in Reno's Old Southwest Neighborhood by the Edmiston Estate It was a custom family home which was granted with surface water rights and access to Lake Ditch's water distribution for irrigation. In the 1980s a 400ft well was drilled enabling access to 160° F ground water and the house was converted to run off geothermal energy to heat the house as well as the hot tub & pool.
